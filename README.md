# comingsoon-landing-page
A basic coming soon or subscribe to newsletter page with a resumé above the input to subscribe yourself.

## For who is this page
This page is made for those people who:
- Want to create a blog or have their own newsletter.
- Want to start a business or an idea and needs a comingsoon page.

It helps them to have a page instantly just forking the project or taking the source code.

## Metrics centric
I've wanted to build a fast page with a beautiful design so the user could have a good user experience.
I know there is room for improvement, but this is quite good for a first iteration as we can see.

## How to customize
There are a few thinks to customize:
- Color palette
- Pattern of the header
- Manifest.json (for PWA)
- Where to send the email you want to store

## Color palette:
I'm following the structure I use in all the projects:
```
const theme = {
  palette: {
    primary: {
      // green
      900: "hsl(125, 73%, 20%)",
      700: "hsl(122, 39%, 41%)", // hover, focus, selected effects
      500: "hsl(123, 35%, 51%)", // Buttons, Badges, borders...
      300: "hsl(126, 49%, 84%)",
      100: "hsl(125, 65%, 93%)"
    },
    grey: {
      900: "hsl(0, 0%, 23%)", // Titles
      700: "hsl(0, 0%, 38%)", // Paragraphs, ...
      600: "hsl(0, 0%, 49%)", // Disabled button text-color
      500: "hsl(0, 0%, 62%)", // Some details
      300: "hsl(0, 0%, 81%)", // Disabled button bg
      200: "hsl(0, 0%, 91%)", // Footers of modals, background of other sections...
      100: "hsl(0, 0%, 97%)" // Background
    },
    accent: {
      red: {
        900: "hsl(360, 85%, 25%)",
        700: "hsl(360, 67%, 44%)",
        500: "hsl(360, 64%, 55%)",
        300: "hsl(360, 82%, 89%)",
        100: "hsl(360, 100%, 97%)"
      },
      yellow: {
        900: "hsl(43, 77%, 27%)",
        700: "hsl(43, 78%, 60%)",
        500: "hsl(43, 89%, 70%)",
        300: "hsl(45, 90%, 88%)",
        100: "hsl(45, 100%, 96%)"
      }
    },
    social: {
      fb: "#29487d",
      ig: "#e95950",
      tw: "#55acee",
      in: "#007bb5",
      wu: "#4dc247"
    }
  },
  font: {
    family: {
        primary: '"Raleway", Open-sans, sans-serif',
        secondary: undefined,
        serif: '"Merriweather", serif;'
      }
  }
};
```

Since in this project we just need a couple of colors, I've translated the palette to this:
```
:root {
  --font-family-primary: "Nunito", sans-serif;
  --font-family-secondary: "Domine", serif;

  --primary-700: #0b78df;
  --primary-500: #0083ff;
  --primary-100: hsl(125, 65%, 93%);

  --grey-900: hsl(0, 0%, 23%);
  --grey-700: hsl(0, 0%, 38%);
  --grey-100: hsl(0, 0%, 97%);

  --accent-red-700: #af0900;
}
```
Where 100 is the lightest color and 900 is the darkest. It provides you the oportunity to add as much specification as you prefer.
You can or select:
- `300`,`500`and `700`
- `100`, `300`,`500`,`700`,`900`
- `100`,`200`, `300`,`400`,`500`,`600`,`700`,`800`,`900`
Depending on how much detail you want.
